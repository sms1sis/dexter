# Dexter

An advanced, high-performance Android DexOpt status analyzer written in Rust. This tool replaces slow shell scripts by efficiently parsing global package status from `dumpsys` and correlating it with installed apps.

## Features

- **Blazing Fast**: Captures global state in a single pass instead of per-package lookups.
- **Robust Label Resolution**: Uses a hybrid approach (Native Parsing + `aapt` fallback) to correctly identify app names, even for split APKs.
- **Visuals**: Unicode-aware, perfectly aligned boxes that respect your terminal width.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by package name or **DexOpt Status** (e.g., find all `error` or `run-from-apk` apps).
- **App Optimization**: Force optimize specific apps, batch-optimize all unoptimized user apps, or trigger a system-wide background dexopt job.
- **JSON Output**: Export structured data for automation and scripts.
- **Root Check**: Built-in validation to ensure proper privileges.

## Requirements

- **Termux** or a Linux environment on Android.
- **Root access** (`su` or `tsu`) is required.
- **aapt** (Android Asset Packaging Tool) is recommended for best results (fetching labels for system apps), but the tool works without it.
- **Rust/Cargo** (for building from source).

## Installation

1. **Install Dependencies** (Termux):
   ```bash
   pkg install rust openssl
   # Optional but recommended:
   pkg install aapt
   ```

2. **Build from Source**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sms1sis/dexter.git
   cd dexter
   # We use system OpenSSL to avoid complex cross-compilation on Android
   OPENSSL_NO_VENDOR=1 cargo build --release
   ```

The binary will be available at `target/release/dexter`.

## Usage

Run the tool with root privileges:

```bash
# Analyze user apps (default)
sudo ./target/release/dexter

# Analyze system apps
sudo ./target/release/dexter -t system

# Show verbose details for each package
sudo ./target/release/dexter -v

# Filter by name
sudo ./target/release/dexter -f google

# Filter by dexopt status
sudo ./target/release/dexter -s run-from-apk

# Output as JSON (useful for scripts)
sudo ./target/release/dexter -j

# Optimize a specific package (clears profiles then compiles to 'speed')
sudo ./target/release/dexter -o com.example.app

# Trigger system background dexopt job
sudo ./target/release/dexter -o all

# Batch-optimize all user apps that lack speed/speed-profile
sudo ./target/release/dexter -m
```

### Options

```text
Usage: dexter [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -f, --filter <FILTER>    Filter packages by name (substring match)
  -s, --status <STATUS>    Filter by specific dexopt status (e.g., 'speed', 'verify', 'error')
  -t, --type <TYPE>        Type of applications to analyze [default: user] [possible values: user, system, all]
  -v, --verbose            Show detailed information for each package
  -j, --json               Output results as JSON
  -o, --optimize <TARGET>  Optimize application(s). Use 'all' for background dexopt job, or specify a package name
  -m, --optimize-missing   Optimize all user apps that have no split part with 'speed' or 'speed-profile' status
  -h, --help               Print help
  -V, --version            Print version
```

### DexOpt Status Reference

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `speed` | Fully compiled to native code — best runtime performance |
| `speed-profile` | Compiled based on a profile — good balance of performance and install size |
| `verify` | Bytecode verified only — slower at runtime |
| `quicken` | Lightly optimized bytecode — faster than verify, slower than speed |
| `run-from-apk` | Not compiled at all — runs directly from the APK |
| `error` | Compilation failed |
